# Hobbies

## Piano

I've always had an ear for music and was very interested when I played on my first keyboard all those years ago.
Since then, I have gotten to RCM level 9 with a deep understanding of music and technique.
Recently, I decided to stop my lessons and continue playing and composing music individually for some more freedom.

## Graphic Design and Film

For personal reasons, I wanted to learned how to make videos and edit photos (this was mostly for a YouTube channel I had going on) and I was looking for 
some tutorials and tips online, and I had also enrolled in a Communications Technology course at my school. This was never a direct career goal or interest, 
but I have learned so much from this and now take pride in and actively like making creative media texts.
