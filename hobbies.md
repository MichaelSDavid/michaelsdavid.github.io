# Hobbies

## Piano

I always had an ear for music and was very interested when I played on my first keyboard all those years ago.
Since then, I have gotten to RCM level 9 with a deep understanding of music and technique.
Recently, I decided to stop my lessons and continue playing and composing music individually for some more freedom.
