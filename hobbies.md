# Hobbies

## Piano

I always had an ear for music and was very interested when I played on my first keyboard all those years ago.<br/>
Since then, I have gotten to RCM level 9 with a deep understanding of music and technique.<br/>
Recently I had to stop my lessons, but I continue to play and compose on my own every chance I get.
