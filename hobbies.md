# Hobbies

## Piano

<!-- Make iFrames responsive for mobile in the future (as well as header bar potentially) -->

I've always had an ear for music and was very interested when I played on my first keyboard all those years ago.
Since then, I have gotten to RCM level 9 with a deep understanding of music and technique.
Recently, I moved on to playing and composing music individually for some more freedom.

## Graphic Design and Film

For personal reasons, I wanted to learned how to make videos and edit photos (this was mostly for a YouTube channel I had going on). I was looking for 
some tutorials/tips online and I had also enrolled in a Communications Technology course at my school. This was never a direct career goal or interest, 
but I have learned so much from these and now take pride in actively making creative media texts, as well help this has given to advance how I display my personal image through this medium.

## Karate

Martial arts have always been very interesting and respected by me for the ancient traditions as well as modern self-defence applications. I first started my small journey in an after-school program with Taekwondo in elementary school, but it wasn't as useful compared to something in a traditional dojo. Later on, I got an invite by one of my friends to try out a free class at a Northern Karate Schools (NKS) dojo and it just clicked there. I got started right away and was a dedicated student eventually reaching up to 2nd degree black belt in ranking. I still practice occasionaly on my own for physical fitness as well as keeping general self-defence in my mind because you never know what could happen out there.

## Ballroom Dancing

When most people say they are dancers, it's usually in styles like jazz, contemporary, hip-hop, etc. that kind of thing. However, I fall into a different category. My parents decided to sign me and my sister up for ballroom dancing as partners. It seemed very awkward at the beginning, but we soon learned to like the style and its special quirks. We decided to also go competitive and participate in competitions up to reaching pre-champ rank (that last year being very intensive) and winning many medals. Participating in dance has helped grow my self-esteem as well as boosting my image as parties (particularly with a partner). Right now, I still occasionaly review some routines if I have time with myself and my sister so that the practice has not gone for naught, and I can apply them to real social scenarios.
