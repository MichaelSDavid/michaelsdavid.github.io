  <p>
    Python - As a general-purpose programming language, I use it for basically everything. Automation, ethical hacking, DS/ML, desktop development, even recently started learning a little bit of Django for web. EX

    Java - My first compiled language. I mainly use it for Android development, desktop development, as well as some game development with LibGDX and modding in Minecraft.

  <p>
    JavaScript - No software developer can live without JS, and that's the same for me. I had mainly been using it for small, simple web projects and only recently hopped on to try serverless and hybrid frameworks like Node, Deno, and React / React Native.

  <p>
    C/C++ - I wanted to get some low-level programming experience and there is no way better than C/C++. I started both at basically the same time and mainly use them for desktop development, language development, and some game development with Cocos2d-x.
