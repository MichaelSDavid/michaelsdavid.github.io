# Technologies
<br/>

<div style="margin: 0 auto;">
  <img style="float: left; margin-right:2rem;" src="images/py.png" alt="python" width="80"/>
  <p>
    <strong>Python</strong> - As a general-purpose programming language, I use it for basically everything. Automation, ethical hacking, DS/ML, desktop development, even recently started learning a little bit of Django for web.
  </p>
</div>

<br/>

<div style="margin: 0 auto;">
  <img style="float: left; margin-right:2rem;" src="images/java.png" alt="java" width="80"/>
  <p>
    <strong>Java</strong> - My first compiled language. I mainly use it for Android development, desktop development, as well as some game development with LibGDX and modding in Minecraft.
  </p>
</div>

<br/>

<div style="margin: 0 auto;">
  <img style="float: left; margin-right:2rem;" src="images/js.png" alt="javascript" width="80"/>
  <p>
    <strong>JavaScript</strong> - No software developer can live without JS, and that's the same for me. I had mainly been using it for small, simple web projects and only recently hopped on to try serverless and hybrid frameworks like Node, Deno, and React / React Native.
  </p>
</div>

<div style="margin: 0 auto;">
  <img style="float: left; margin-right:2rem;" src="images/c2p.png" alt="c++" width="80"/>
  <p>
    <strong>C/C++</strong> - I wanted to get some low-level programming experience and there is no way better than C/C++. I started both together and mainly use them for desktop development, language development, and some game development with Cocos2d-x.
  </p>
</div>

<div style="margin: 0 auto;">
  <img style="float: left; margin-right:2rem;" src="images/jb.png" alt="jetbrains" width="80"/>
  <p>
    <strong>JetBrains IDEs</strong> - I had been using a text editor for basically everything until last year where I upgraded to full IDEs for each platform. They have incredible features and I use them almost everyday. IntelliJ, PyCharm, RubyMine, you name it. 
  </p>
</div>

<br/>

<div style="margin: 0 auto;">
  <img style="float: left; margin-right:2rem;" src="images/git.png" alt="git" width="80"/>
  <p>
    <strong>Git</strong> - VCS is a must for any updatable project and I hopped on the Git train. Only really started being active this past summer with Multility and all these other recent tiny projects of mine, but I don't think I could ever go back to working without it.
  </p>

<div style="margin: 0 auto;">
  <img style="float: left; margin-right:2rem;" src="images/droid.png" alt="android" width="80"/>
  <p>
    <strong>Android</strong> - One of the two dominating mobile platforms. Android development is very fun and there's a lot of freedom from Google's policies and guidelines. Only worked on Multility so far, but I bet I will make more apps in the future.
  </p>

<br/>

<div style="margin: 0 auto;">
  <img style="float: left; margin-right:2rem;" src="images/ap.png" alt="ios" width="80"/>
  <p>
    <strong>iOS</strong> - The other dominating platform on mobile. Apple's platform has always been interesting to me with the very sophisticated aesthetic and streamlined process, but I'm on board with it for porting Multility to iOS and making other apps as well.
